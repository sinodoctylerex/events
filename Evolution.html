		&#8226;Life began on Earth at least 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, and it has been evolving ever since. At first, all living things on Earth were simple, single-celled organisms. <br>
		 &#8226;More complex forms of life took longer to evolve, with the first multicellular animals not appearing until about 600 million years ago.<br>
		 &#8226;Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, started out on Earth quite a while ago. Possible fossil examples have been found in rocks that are around 3500 million years old, in Western Australia.<br>

				 epithelia predate the origin of metazoans and are the first organized tissues found in evolution.<br>
				 &#8226;Sponges were among the earliest animals. While chemical compounds
				 \ from sponges are preserved in rocks as old as 700 million years, molecular evidence points to sponges developing even earlier. The evolutionary history of the comb jelly has revealed surprising clues about Earth's first animal.<br>
